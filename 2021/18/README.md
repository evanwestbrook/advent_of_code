# Part 1
### Initial approach
When I initially approach this solution, I thought using `eval()` to parse each string into an array and then apply additional logic was a no brainer. After successfully applying basic `add` and `split` functionality, I started to get stumped on `explode`. I knew it would be some sort of recursive analysis, and I was getting stumped at the concept of determining which element of an array and at which depth to explode. I had also fallen intro the trap on previous AoC challenges with spending way too much time chasing a recursive problem. I also started to think that actual string parsing might be better off. In other words, maybe the solution lay closer to counting the # of array like characters than actually traversing a nested array repeatedly.
